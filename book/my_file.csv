desc,Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start
dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green
ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated
by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great
beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some
astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to
begin! These new editions of the classic and internationally bestselling,
multi-award-winning series feature instantly pick-up-able new jackets by
Jonny Duddle, with huge child appeal, to bring Harry Potter to the next
generation of readers. It's time to PASS THE MAGIC ON .
